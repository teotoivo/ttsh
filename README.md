  ## Project Vision
   - [ ] Implement basic command execution.
   - [ ] Add support for command-line arguments.
   - [ ] Implement a basic prompt.
   - [ ] Implement built-in commands (`cd`, `exit`, `help`).
   - [ ] Add support for pipes (`|`).
   - [ ] Add support for input/output redirection (`>`, `<`).
   - [ ] Implement basic job control (e.g., `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+Z`, `bg`, `fg`).
   - [ ] Add a history feature (using arrow keys).
   - [ ] Implement tab completion.
   - [ ] Add support for shell scripts.
   - [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback.
